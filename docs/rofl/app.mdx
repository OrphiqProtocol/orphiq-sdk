# Application

This chapter will show you how to quickly create, build and test a minimal
containerized ROFL app that communicated with a confidential smart contract on
[Oasis Sapphire].

ROFL apps come in different flavors and the right choice is a tradeoff between
TCB size and ease of use. The easiest to use are TDX container-based apps which
are presented in this guide and more advanced flavors with smaller TCBs are
described separately.

## How do ROFL Apps Work?

![ROFL diagram](images/rofl.svg)

Each ROFL app runs in its own Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which is
provisioned by an Oasis Node from its _bundle_ (a zip archive containing the
program binaries and metadata required for execution). ROFL apps register to
the Oasis Network in order to be able to easily authenticate to on-chain smart
contracts and transparently gain access to the decentralized per-app key
management system.

Inside the TEE, the ROFL app performs important functions that ensure its
security and enable secure communication with the outside world. This includes
using a light client to establish a fresh view of the Oasis consensus layer
which provides a source of rough time and integrity for verification of all
on-chain state. The ROFL app also generates a set of ephemeral cryptographic
keys which are used in the process of remote attestation and on-chain
registration. These processes ensure that the ROFL app can authenticate to
on-chain modules (e.g. smart contracts running in the [Sapphire runtime]) by
signing and submitting special transactions.

The ROFL app can then perform arbitrary work and interact with the outside world
through (properly authenticated) network connections. Connections can be
authenticated via HTTPS/TLS or use other methods (e.g. light clients for other
chains).

## App Directory and Manifest

First we create the basic directory structure for the ROFL app using the Oasis
CLI:

```shell
oasis rofl init myapp
```

This will create the `myapp` directory and initialize some boilerplate needed to
build a TDX container-based ROFL app. The rest of the guide assumes that you are
executing commands from within this directory.

The command will output a summary of what is being created:

```
Creating a new ROFL app with default policy...
Name:     myapp
Version:  0.1.0
TEE:      tdx
Kind:     container
Created manifest in 'rofl.yaml'.
Run `oasis rofl create` to register your ROFL app and configure an app ID.
```

The directory structure will look as follows:

```
myapp
├── compose.yaml        # Container compose file.
└── rofl.yaml           # ROFL app manifest.
```

The manifest contains things like ROFL app metadata, [secrets],
[requested resources] and can be modified either manually or by using the CLI
commands.

[secrets]: features.md#secrets
[requested resources]: resources.md

## Create

Before the ROFL app can be built it needs to be created on chain to assign it a
unique identifier (the app ID) which can be used by on-chain smart contracts to
ensure that they are talking to the right app and also gives the app access to a
decentralized key management system.

Anyone with enough funds can create an app. Currently, this threshold is 100
TEST on Sapphire Testnet and Localnet (funded automatically). ROFL registration
on Sapphire Mainnet is yet to be enabled.

:::tip

In order to obtain TEST tokens needed for creating and running your ROFL apps
use [the faucet] or [ask on Discord]. To make things easier you should
[create or import a `secp256k1-bip44` account] that you can also use with the
Ethereum-compatible tooling like Hardhat.

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

:::

We also need to select the network (in this case `testnet`) and the account
that will be the initial administrator of the ROFL app (in this case
`myaccount`). The CLI will automatically update the app manifest (`rofl.yaml`)
with the assigned app identifier.

```shell
oasis rofl create --network testnet --account myaccount
```

After successful creation, the CLI will also output the new identifier:

```
Created ROFL application: rofl1qqn9xndja7e2pnxhttktmecvwzz0yqwxsquqyxdf
```

The app deployer account automatically becomes the initial admin of the app so
it can update the app's configuration. The admin address can always be changed
by the current admin.

:::info

While the CLI implements a simple governance mechanism where the admin of the
ROFL app is a single account, even a smart contract can be the admin. This
allows for implementation of advanced agent governance mechanisms, like using
multi-sigs or DAOs with veto powers to control the upgrade process.

:::

:::tip App ID calculation

App ID is derived using one of the two schemes:

- **Creator address + creator account nonce (default)**: This approach is
  suitable for running tests (e.g. in [`sapphire-localnet`]) where you want
  deterministic app ID.
- **Creator address + block round number + index of the `rofl.Create`
  transaction in the block**: This approach is non-deterministic and preferred
  in production environments so that the potential attacker cannot simply
  determine ROFL app ID in advance, even if they knew what the creator address
  is.

You can select the app ID derivation scheme by passing the
[`--scheme` parameter][scheme-parameter].

## Oracle Contract

:::info

While we are using [EVM-based smart contracts] in this example, the on-chain
part can be anything from a [WASM-based smart contract] to a dedicated
[runtime module].

[EVM-based smart contracts]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/build/sapphire/README.mdx
[WASM-based smart contract]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/build/tools/other-paratimes/cipher/README.mdx
[runtime module]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/blob/main/docs/runtime/modules.md

:::

We have prepared a simple oracle contract for this example. You can find it by
checking out the [prepared example project] from the Oasis SDK repository. It
contains a simple [Oracle.sol] contract which collects observations from
authenticated ROFL app instances, performs trivial aggregation and stores the
final aggregated result. Read the [Sapphire quickstart] chapter to learn how to
build and deploy Sapphire smart contracts, but to get you up and running for
this part, simply copy the example project from above, install dependencies and
compile the smart contract by executing:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

Configure the `PRIVATE_KEY` of the deployment account and the ROFL app
identifier (be sure to use the identifier that you received during
registration), then deploy the contract by running, for example:

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" \
npx hardhat deploy rofl1qqn9xndja7e2pnxhttktmecvwzz0yqwxsquqyxdf --network sapphire-testnet
```

After successful deployment you will see a message like:

```
Oracle for ROFL app rofl1qqn9xndja7e2pnxhttktmecvwzz0yqwxsquqyxdf deployed to 0x1234845aaB7b6CD88c7fAd9E9E1cf07638805b20
```

You can now proceed to building and deploying the ROFL app itself. Remember the
address where the oracle contract was deployed to as you will need it in the
next step.

## Define Containerized Services

What the core of the ROFL app does is defined with services running in Podman
containers defined in [the compose file]. Anything that can run as a bunch of
containers can also be run as a ROFL app.

For an easier start, we will use the `oasisprotocol/demo-rofl` container which
is defined in [the `demo-rofl` repository] and implements [a trivial oracle] in
a shell script.

The compose file (`compose.yaml`) looks as follows:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  oracle:
    # See the 'docker' subdirectory in demo-rofl for the content of this image.
    # Note that we are using the sha256 hash of the image to ensure integrity.
    image: docker.io/oasisprotocol/demo-rofl:latest@sha256:42c32ccfe0a0c84ac5969a1399e4658bed8e8d1517cc6b26cdce67439c66c910
    environment:
      # Address of the oracle contract deployed on Sapphire Testnet.
      - CONTRACT_ADDRESS=1234845aaB7b6CD88c7fAd9E9E1cf07638805b20
      # Ticker.
      - TICKER=ROSEUSDT
    volumes:
      - /run/rofl-appd.sock:/run/rofl-appd.sock
```

:::warning Always specify FQDN image URL

When specifying the container image URL, make sure to use fully qualified domain
name e.g. `docker.io/ollama/ollama` and not just `ollama/ollama`.

## Build

Whenever you make changes to your ROFL app and want to deploy it, you first need
to build it. The build process takes the compose file together with other ROFL
app artifacts and deterministically generates a bundle that can later be
deployed.

The build process also computes the _enclave identity_ of the bundle which is
used during the process of remote attestation to authenticate the app instances
before granting them access to the key management system and [other features].

To build a ROFL app and update the enclave identity in the app manifest, simply
run:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Native Linux">
        ```shell
        oasis rofl build
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Docker (Windows, Mac, Linux)">
        ```shell
        docker run --platform linux/amd64 --volume .:/src -it ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/rofl-dev:main oasis rofl build
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate the resulting ROFL app bundle which can be used for later
deployment and output something like:

```
ROFL app built and bundle written to 'myapp.default.orc'.
```

[other features]: features.md

## Update On-chain App Config

After any changes to the ROFL app policy defined in the manifest, the on-chain
app config needs to be updated in order for the changes to take effect.

The designated admin account is able to update this policy by issuing an update
transaction which can be done via the CLI by running:

```shell
oasis rofl update
```
