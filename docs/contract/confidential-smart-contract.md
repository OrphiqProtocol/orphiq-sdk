# Confidential Hello World

Confidential smart contract execution on Oasis is assured by three mechanisms:

- the contract is executed in a trusted execution environment,
- the contract's storage on the blockchain is encrypted,
- the client's transactions and queries are end-to-end encrypted.

The first mechanism is implemented as part of the ParaTime attestation process
on the consensus layer and is opaque to the dApp developer.

The other two mechanisms are available to dApp developers. The remainder of
this chapter will show you how to use an encrypted contract storage
and perform contract operations with end-to-end encryption on Cipher.

## Confidential cell

In the [hello world](./hello-world.md) example we used
[`PublicCell<T>`][PublicCell] to access the key-value store
of that contract instance. In this case the value was stored unencrypted on the
blockchain associated with the hash of the key we provided to the constructor
(e.g., the `counter` in `PublicCell::new(b"counter")`).

Cipher supports another primitive [`ConfidentialCell<T>`][ConfidentialCell]
which enables you to store and load data confidentially assured by
hardware-level encryption. In addition, the value is encrypted along with a
nonce so that it appears different each time to the blockchain observer, even
if the decrypted value remains equal. Namely, the nonce is generated from:

- the round number,
- the number of the sub-call during current smart contract execution,
- the number of confidential storage accesses from smart contracts in the
  current block.

:::danger

The location of the confidential cell inside the contract state is
**still based on the initialization key passed to the constructor**.
Consequently, if you declare a number of confidential cells and write to the
same one on each call, the blockchain observers will notice that the same
cell is being changed every time.

:::

To call the confidential cell getter and setter, you will need to provide the
instance of the *confidential store*. The store is obtained by calling
`confidential_store()` on the contract's *context* object. If, for example, the
node operator will try to execute your code in a non-confidential environment,
they would not obtain the keys required to perform decryption so the operation
would fail.

Now, let's look at how a confidential version of the hello world smart contract
would look like:

![code rust](../../examples/contract-sdk/c10l-hello-world/src/lib.rs "src/lib.rs")
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

The contract is built the same way as its non-confidential counterpart:

```shell
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

:::caution

The blockchain store containing all compiled contracts is public. This means
that anyone will be able to decompile your smart contract and see how it
works. **Do not put any sensitive data inside the smart contract code!**

:::

Since the smart contracts store is public, uploading the Wasm code is
the same as for the non-confidential ones:

```shell
oasis contract upload hello_world.wasm
```

## Confidential Instantiation and Calling

To generate an encrypted transaction, the `oasis contract` subcommand
expects a `--encrypted` flag. The client (`oasis` command in our case) will
generate and use an ephemeral keypair for encryption. If the original
transaction was encrypted, the returned transaction result will also be
encrypted inside the trusted execution environment to prevent a
man-in-the-middle attack by the compute node.

Encrypted transactions have the following encrypted fields:
contract address, function name, parameters and the amounts and types of tokens
sent.

**Encrypted transactions are not anonymous!** Namely, the transaction contains
unencrypted public key of your account or a list of expected multisig keys,
the gas limit and the amount of fee paid for the transaction execution.

:::danger

While the transaction execution is confidential, its effects may reveal some
information. For example, the account balances are public. If the effect is,
say, subtraction of 10 tokens from the signer's account, this most probably
implies that they have been transferred as part of this transaction.

:::

Before we instantiate the contract we need to consider the gas usage of our
confidential smart contract. Since the execution of the smart contract is
dependent on the (confidential) smart contract state, the gas limit cannot be
computed automatically. Currently, the gas limit for confidential transactions
is tailored towards simple transaction execution (e.g. no gas is reserved for
accessing the contract state). For more expensive transactions, we
need to explicitly pass the `--gas-limit` parameter and *guess* the sufficient
value for now or we will get the `out of gas` error. For example, to
instantiate our smart contract above with a single write to the contract state,
we need to raise the gas limit to `60000`:

```shell
oasis contract instantiate CODEID '{instantiate: {initial_counter: 42}}' --encrypted --gas-limit 400000
```

:::danger

The `out of gas` error can **potentially reveal the (confidential) state of the
smart contract**! If your smart contract contains a branch which depends on the
value stored in the contract state, an attack similar to the **timing attack**
known from the design of cryptographic algorithms can succeed. To overcome this,
your code should **never contain branches depending on secret smart contract
state**.

A similar gas limit attack could reveal the **client's transaction parameters**.
For example, if calling function `A` costs `50,000` gas units and function `B`
`300,000` gas units, the attacker could imply which function call was performed
based on the transaction's gas limit, which is public. To mitigate this attack,
the client should always use the maximum gas cost among all contract function
calls - in this case `300,000`.

:::

Finally, we make a confidential call:

```shell
oasis contract call INSTANCEID '{say_hello: {who: "me"}}' --encrypted --gas-limit 400000
```

:::tip Call Format

The [Context] object has a special [`call_format`] attribute which holds
information on whether the transaction was encrypted by the client's ephemeral
key or not. Having access control based on this value is useful as an
additional safety precaution to prevent leakage of any confidential
information unencrypted out of the trusted execution environment by mistake.

:::

:::danger

Regardless of the encrypted transaction and confidential storage used in the
smart contract, any [emitted event][emit_event] will be public.
